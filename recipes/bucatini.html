        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 pound bucatini (dry)</li>
            <li>2 cups finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1 Â½ tablespoons freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt. Cook bucatini in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place grated Pecorino Romano cheese into a large glass bowl and mix with a fork to make sure the cheese contains no lumps.</li>
            <li>Once the bucatini are al dente, lift them out with a spaghetti fork or tongs and put them directly into the bowl with the cheese. Do not allow the water to drain too much.</li>
            <li>Add one ladle of pasta water to the bowl. Stir the bucatini around until a cream has formed. Add more pasta water, little by little, until a thick cream has formed. Sprinkle freshly ground pepper over the pasta. Toss and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
